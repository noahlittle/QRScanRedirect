# QRScanRedirect
Barebones implementation of nimiq/qr-scanner that reads QR codes from the browser and redirects the user to the link specified in the QR code.


## Usage
Useful for minimizing hassle of downloading an app or differences in native camera apps' QR recognition - it's hands off scanning from in the browser here.

Should work as-is across browsers in index.html.
